## Solar Power Monitoring System
ontains a collection of files and resources related to a project focused on monitoring solar power systems. The primary objective of this project appears to be the monitoring and management of solar energy generation and usage.

The repository's contents include:

# Arduino Program Implementation: 
This folder contains the code written in the Arduino programming language that runs on an Arduino microcontroller or similar hardware. This code is responsible for collecting data from various sensors and components, processing the data, and possibly communicating it to a central system.

# Circuit Diagram: 
The folder include a circuit diagram or schematic that illustrates the connections between different electronic components in the solar power monitoring system. This diagram helps users understand how the hardware components are wired together.

# Block Diagram: 
The block diagram is a higher-level representation that shows the functional blocks of the entire system and how they interact with each other. It provides an overview of the system's architecture and how different components communicate or collaborate.
